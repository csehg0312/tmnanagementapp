# Task Management App

A simple task management app built with **Vue.js 3** that allows users to create, manage, and filter tasks. This app also includes a **Dark Mode** feature that can be toggled by the user, with their preference stored locally.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a title, description, and category.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted from the task list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can toggle tasks as completed or pending.
- **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by their completion status (All, Completed, Pending).
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Users can toggle between dark and light modes. The selected mode will persist across page reloads.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks and theme preferences are saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring data persists when the page is refreshed.
